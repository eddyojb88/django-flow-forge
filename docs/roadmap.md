# Roadmap

This is highly subject to change depending on demand but for now, some features that may need to be addressed:

 - Develop a Task stepwise debugging helper
 - Implement better authentication and authorization options (at the moment you have to import the views in to urls and add login_required
 - Make stakeholder only facing dashboard to display only tasks that succeeded
 - Write better tests
 - Feature other async libraries
