# django_mlops
 Utilities for Data Scientists and Engineers looking to simplify ML Ops without unnecessary complexity.

## Motivation?
Philosophy:

An ML system should be simple enough that an ops colleague can 

(1) Find out when it isnâ€™t working properly

(2) Make small changes to it

(3) Redeploy the model

The problem with todays tools is that they feel like learning enormous packages with fancy webserves and a lot of bloat without solving the problems flexibly, This was the motivation behind Django-mlops - in our teams case it solves it all end to end.

MLOps sounds like a made up sales term. However, it is necessary in data science projects to:

- Design and keep track of data science projects in a way that can be communicated easily to team members and stakeholders easily
- Offer optional scalability in data ops or model training in order to find solutions to complex problems

Key Features:
- Simple and mature framework with Django philosophy of robustness with safety and security
- Definition of pipelines processes in a data science context (but it is flexible to work in any context)
- Visualization of DAGs, doubling up as a tool for stakeholder interactions (inspired by Kedro)
- To do: Connectors to e.g. Celery in order to run DAGs using dependencies
- Scalable archtecture, working with Celery nicely or Kubernetes. Like any project ever, this requires design and implementation


Why Django and not Flask, FastAPI etc.
- Opinions are important, especially if they help your app stay secure and manageable. Flask and FastAPI is supposed to be lightweight but every project I go on ends up recreating logic that Django already has but badly and closed sourced. Why not skip the duplication and complexity?
- Django is easy to deploy Dockerize securely and scalably on any cloud service, keeping your options flexible
- Django-ninja is FastAPI for Django, offering a fast way to serve models in a coupled or decoupled manner
- Move fast by start off your project simple with django and decouple as and when you need. As you scale, your app in Django doesnt necessarily need to be rewritten
